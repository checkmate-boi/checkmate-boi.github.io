        <!-- start text -->
<p>I first touched a chessboard at the age of 5. Obviously I wasn&rsquo;t old enough at the time to comprehend any of its rules, but my older brother knew how to play, and I often watched him face off with my dad. Dad wasn&rsquo;t especially good, but he always won. My brother would always challenge him for a rematch, probably hoping that one day he might actually win. In the end that day never came, and by the time he entered middle school, chess was only a vague memory in his head, and his chessboard became an antique in his closet.</p>

<p>Spring 2002</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creaaaak...</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I poked my head into the slightly opened door, looking around to make sure that there wasn't anybody inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quietly sneaked into my brother's room, and quickly started looking through his things. He would be home in an hour maybe, I had to maximize this time. His desk drawers? No. His cabinet? No. His schoolbag? No. Maybe hidden in his clothing drawers? No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darn it. No Gameboy anywhere. He must've taken it with him today. And I was looking forward to playing Pokemon Silver too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>sigh~</em> I lay down on his bed and stared at his ceiling, bored out of my mind.<em></em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there nothing to do at all? There&rsquo;s nothing to watch on the telly. Maybe I can read some comic books from the library? Hm..</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My eyes floated towards the mirror that was in the room, one of those tall mirrors that you could get at IKEA. I hopped off of the bed, and as was almost instinctively for a 6 year old, I began posing in front of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fireball!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hadouken!!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em></em>Then something caught my eye in the mirror&rsquo;s reflection. <em>Huh? What's that?</em> I saw something in the closet I'd left open. I turned back to it to check it out. It was my brother's old chess board, untouched for a while. It had piled on a thin layer of dust. There was a small wooden box next to it also covered in dust, likely containing the pieces. I opened it to check, and sure enough, they were all lined up in there, as if they were just waiting for someone to find and use them.</p>
