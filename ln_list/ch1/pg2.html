    <div class="novel">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Oh it's been a while since I&rsquo;ve seen this. Well I guess this&rsquo;ll do for now...</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grabbed the board along with the box of pieces and went into the living room where my dad was reading a newspaper on the couch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dad let&rsquo;s play chess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad turned his head. &ldquo;You know how to play?&rdquo; he asked with an eyebrow raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know the gist of it.&rdquo; I said in a voice much more confident than it should have been. From the numerous times I&rsquo;d seen my brother play with him, and chess occasionally showing up on the telly every so often, I had a decent idea of the mechanics of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put down his newspaper on the coffee table and stood up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right then, let&rsquo;s have a go shall we?&rdquo; he said seemingly pumped up. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t turn down a challenge. I&rsquo;m gonna heat up some tea first, you can set up the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You can play white by the way, it goes-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;-First. Yeah, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ok, ok. Just making sure.&rdquo; dad replied, with a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started setting up the board. It was a wooden chess set, with very flamboyant carved pieces. One side with tan wood and the other painted black, they were very nice to look at. The Knights had majestic flowing manes and the Bishops were pointed tall. Each piece had such a clean aesthetic to it, they looked like they should be put on display. The pieces felt very natural in my hand; perfectly weighted. <em>Alright uh Rooks on the end, Bishops inside, knights outside. </em>As I was finishing up, dad came back, now equipped with some warm tea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whenever you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Wait I don&rsquo;t actually know any openings do I... Uh what was that starting move most of the guys on the telly did? Oh right!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I played Pawn E4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad followed up with Pawn E5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I brought my Knight to F3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He played Pawn D6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I continued developing, bringing out my other Knight to C3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After pausing for a second, he brought his Bishop all the way to G4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Wait I&rsquo;ve seen this move a lot before, it had a name... what was it again? Ruri-something? So my Knight is sort of stuck here now I guess... Wait... If I did move it, would dad-</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, hey you&rsquo;ve been thinking for a while now. You thinking of a genius plan or something?&rdquo; dad said with a quick smirk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh sorry I&rsquo;ll play uh...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pawn H3, attacking his Bishop.</p>
