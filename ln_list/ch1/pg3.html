      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He retreated to Bishop H5. <em>Of course he would. No need to further press that. Wait but if I actually did try that and it worked, that&rsquo;d be so awesome. Well here goes</em>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop C4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his Bishop now out of harm&rsquo;s way, he developed a Knight: C6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I captured his E5 Pawn with my Knight</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then almost like a reflex, he immediately took my open Queen with his Bishop. <em>Just as I&rsquo;d hoped</em>. He looked at me and smiled with an eyebrow raised, as if to taunt me for giving him a <em>free</em> Queen. I simply smiled back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I moved my Bishop, capturing his pawn on F7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tilted his head with a <em>hmm</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I asked in a sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing, nothing.&rdquo; His brow furrowed a little, as if he was in denial that he only had one available option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King E7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knight D5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s Checkmate, right?&rdquo; I asked in a fake monotone voice, trying to not scream in excitement. With my brother having never won against dad, it kind of felt like I had just defeated a final boss in a game or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad just sat there looking at the board, deep in thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That was fun. Rematch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Y-yeah, sure. Let me refill my tea first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad had an expression I hadn&rsquo;t seen before. It felt like a mixture of confusion and interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Okay I&rsquo;ll set up the board again.&rdquo; I said while resetting the pieces. &ldquo;This time I&rsquo;ll play black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I continued to play chess over the following years with my parents, and occasionally my friends. The matches were always pretty short, and I remained the undefeated champion. I never thought that I was especially good or anything, it was simply a hobby of mine. Then in 7th Year, when I entered middle school, I discovered that our school had a chess club.</p>
