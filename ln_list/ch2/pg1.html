        <!-- start text -->
        <p>Fall 2006</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. </em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kids started getting up from their seats as the bells rang. The classroom got very loud, as everyone had started meeting up with their friends to go home with.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey Connor let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ight I&rsquo;ll be there in a sec.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I packed my bags, then ran out of the class to meet up with my friend Jacob. We walked down the hall heading towards the stairs to take us down to the 2nd floor, where the front entrance of the school was. We just walked while chatting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yeah, have you bought Pokemon Ranger yet?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No not yet. I want to. Why?&rdquo; he replied.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught 204 of them. I&rsquo;m gonna finish off the last 5 so I can finally get Snorlax this weekend. But I gotta say, I&rsquo;m still not used to the circles.&rdquo; I laughed while saying.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hah that&rsquo;ll probably take the entire weekend. What about your homework?&rdquo; he joked sarcastically.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh shoot. I forgot to hand in homework! Hughes is gonna kill me if I forget again...&rdquo; I said, getting worried. &rdquo;Next week is the PD days as well so I&rsquo;d be handing it in over a week late!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The office should still be open, maybe he&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll meet you at the front gate!&rdquo; I yelled while running back up the stairs. I turned the corner at the top and ran down the hall, heading towards the office. I swung my bag in front of me, and started digging through it for my work while still running.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>No not that. Damn it where is it. Huh what&rsquo;s this? Why is there a chess piece in here? </em>&nbsp;I grabbed what felt like a Knight in my hand. <em>Whatever, I&rsquo;ll just find my work when I get there.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I looked back up, I collided straight into someone, and fell on my butt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ow. Sorry. I was. In. A rush. Uh-&rdquo; I tried to make a cohesive sentence while catching my breath.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked up at the person I had just run into. He had barely been affected, and was still standing. He leaned over, he picked up the piece I had dropped as I fell. It was a black Knight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah that&rsquo;s mi- oh no...&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he stood up straight again I saw his face and realized who I had just bumped into. <em>Why did it have to be him... Oh god.</em> He looked like he was about to say something, and in a panic I started mumbling.</p>
