      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;N-no I&rsquo;m so sorry I didn&rsquo;t mean to I wasn&rsquo;t looking where I was going I&rsquo;m so sorry I-&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Tch.</em> He tossed the piece into my lap and walked past me with heavy steps.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned back to see a teacher just turn around the corner.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, are you okay?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;, fine.&rdquo; I replied hastily, still in a rush about getting to the office. I quickly checked my watch. <em>Ok office is still open.</em> I started bolting down the hall again.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey no running in the halls!&rdquo; the teacher yelled from behind me.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;X&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp; X</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Mr Huges already left back during 6th period, talk to him after your week off.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood defeated in front of the office doors. <em>It is the Friday before his training week after all. I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised he&rsquo;s already left, considering he doesn&rsquo;t even teach anything past 5th period anyways</em>.<em> Welp guess I&rsquo;m screwed. Where&rsquo;s the washroom on the third floor again? I need to wash the sweat off my face</em>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After washing my face, I started heading towards the stairs again. <em>Have I ever properly looked around this side of the school? I don&rsquo;t have any classes here so I guess I haven&rsquo;t. </em>Then something caught my eye.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a door to a classroom without any windows around it. There was a sign on the edge of the door that read-</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Chess Club? Our school has a chess club? Are they good? I guess Jacob wouldn&rsquo;t mind waiting a few extra minutes right? It's just a few... </em>I quietly opened the door and peeked inside, then walked in.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looked to be an old computer room that the school had emptied out, then never repurposed. The desks all had the wire holes cut into the backs, and were arranged like a computer room, with them lined up in 3 rows. Each row consisted of 8 desks, in pairs of 2, facing each other. The row at the far end seemed to be unused as of now, but the 2 near me had tournament chess sets laid out on them, and there were people playing. They all seemed to be seniors, at least judging based on looks alone. As I walked deeper into the room I heard someone call out to me from the row closest to me.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, what year are you in?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned my head to a few kids who were sitting there. They all looked to be around year 9 or 10. One of them had looked over at me, with a sharp look in his eyes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Uh, I&rsquo;m year 7.&rdquo; I faintly replied</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have to be at least year 9 to be here.&rdquo; He said in a serious manner.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah it's a senior only club.&rdquo; Someone else pitched in.</p>
