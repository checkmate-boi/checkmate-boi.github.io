      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see... I guess I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; After having run into <em>him</em> earlier, I was in no mood to get into trouble with anyone.. As I was about to turn back towards the door, I heard the door open once again behind me.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey what&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; said someone who had just entered. Even before I saw him, I already felt as if he was going to be different from these other seniors. He had a friendly, sort of playful voice, as he seemed to break up what could have very possibly lead into a fight. When I saw him, my assumptions were someone confirmed by the warm smile on his face. He was the tallest in the room, though not by much, and his hair and uniform was tidy.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, now, don&rsquo;t scare the poor junior away.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Poor? Scared?</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>&ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t allowed to be here.&rdquo; said one of the others.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m sure we can work something out. After all, we can always appreciate new players.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might have just been me, but at that moment I could swear I got an uncomfortable eerie feeling that there was more to him than meets the eye. From the way he said it, paired with the look on his face, I could tell that this was likely not a person that I wanted to get involved with.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Actually my friend&rsquo;s been waiting for me outside the school for quite some time now; I should probably get going...&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah is that so? Oh well. That&rsquo;s unfortunate.&rdquo; he said in a dead monotone voice. There was a visible disappointment in his expression, but it wasn&rsquo;t like a pity disappointment, but more so a hunter having missed its prey.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I left and shut the door behind me. <em>Well that was tense. But I do wonder if...</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">X&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp; X</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>10 Days later</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was walking down the hall by myself after school. <em>Dear god Hughes destroyed me in front of the whole class. Oh well, I guess I deserved it?</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey kid.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked over to see the tidy looking guy from the Chess Club sitting on the bench by the school library, beckoning me over. <em>Oh he remembers me? Wait, this is my chance!</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the guy from last Friday.&rdquo; I said, pretending as if this encounter hadn&rsquo;t been on my mind this entire past week.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, sorry about the others, they don&rsquo;t really like to associate outside of our little group, and the club technically does have that age restriction.&rdquo;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s fine. Don&rsquo;t tell me you came all this way just to apologize.&rdquo;</p>
