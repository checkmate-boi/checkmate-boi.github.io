        <!-- start text -->
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kyle Morgan was an ordinary guy. There was nothing overly special about him. He came from a family of 4, and had an average number of friends. His grades were a little above average, and he was a bit taller than his classmates. His whole life he&rsquo;d been ordinary, plain, some might even say uninteresting. If there was anything that stood out about him though, it would be his shrewd personality and his interest in the game of chess, and even those were facts not many knew of.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most people, he had heard of the game from his early primary school days, but had not actually had any hands-on experience at it until a while later. He learned the rules of the game at 10 years old, and when he entered secondary school, he had sunk deep into the world of chess. In his past 3 years in middle school, he hadn&rsquo;t lost any momentum. He was active in a local chess club, and had played as a representative at the regional tournament before. Even outside of the community activities, he would study up on his own, furthering his knowledge more and more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His easy going and seemingly kind personality made him an easy person to talk to, while his silently calculating side made him quite the persuasive person. Convincing the school to reopen a completely abandoned club would normally be an impossible task, but he had somehow done the impossible. Most of his classmates perceived him as a generally nice guy, but it was impossible to read what this seemingly normal guy was ever thinking.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, he had been busy with a certain tournament he was competing in, and hadn&rsquo;t been at the school club for a few weeks. On his day back he walked in on his club chasing out a junior boy in Year 7. This was the first time in over a year that anyone new had shown up to the club. From the moment he laid eyes on Connor, he had been intrigued. He immediately wanted to see if the younger boy knew much about chess, and if he did, he wanted to assess his ability. However, the boy acted very timidly, and left almost immediately.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the following week off of school, Kyle waited for Connor afterschool by the front doors, with an offer to let him join the club. His interest was only further piqued when Connor revealed that he had also been meaning to find and make a similar deal with him. Aftering playing a quick test match against him, and losing, he understood that Connor was not the quiet kid he had first made him out to be, but was rather confident in his playing. And as anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like to</p>
