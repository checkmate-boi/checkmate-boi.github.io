      <p>lose does, he asked Connor if he wanted to play another game, this time with a clear intention of winning.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">X&nbsp; X&nbsp; X</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black Queen captures White Queen on C3.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pawn takes C3.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pawn E6.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With each and every move, Kyle could see Connor begin to stress more and more. He had likely never seriously felt the threat of losing before. Especially when he had a lead on material. But surprisingly, he was still somewhat keeping up with him. Kyle was confident that he wouldn&rsquo;t lose, but this kid really was something.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Definitely needs to work on his composure though</em>. Kyle looked up at his opponent. He was very noticeably uncomfortable. He was breathing a bit heavier as well. <em>Well this is the real world. Better get used to it.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop C4.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Oh so he wants a Bishop trade huh. I wonder if he noticed that his Bishop wasn&rsquo;t going to be much use anymore, or he&rsquo;s just nervous and trading down to relieve some tension off the board. Well it&rsquo;s gonna put my Knight in a great spot, so of course I&rsquo;ll take it.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knight takes C4.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rook takes G4.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Material isn&rsquo;t everything in a game. Oh well... you&rsquo;ll learn eventually. </em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop E5.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rook G2.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Is he protecting D2? So he has at least some positional awareness, though it seems to be mostly subconscious for now. I guess that&rsquo;s just raw talent. But that won&rsquo;t last you long-term. Talent without proper training won&rsquo;t get you anywhere. I&rsquo;ll prevent A4 with B5 for now... if he happens to take it I&rsquo;ll get a passed Pawn.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pawn B5.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rook F2.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Trying to recover by gaining a tempo with the Knight? Okay no he&rsquo;s really just freaking out at this point, he&rsquo;s really rushing. Wait... if I go G8 then I can start moving my Knight again; the Rook won&rsquo;t be able to come in. Well that&rsquo;s convenient.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King G8.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s he gonna do now?&rsquo;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pawn A4.</p>
